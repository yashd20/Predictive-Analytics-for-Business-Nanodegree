# Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree Capstone Project
The final project of the Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree by Udacity: [Predictive Analytics Capstone](https://github.com/yashd20/Predictive-Analytics-for-Business-Nanodegree/blob/master/Predictive%20Analytics%20Capstone.pdf)

The project was split into 3 tasks.

### Task 1 
Your company currently has 85 grocery stores and is planning to open 10 new stores at the beginning of the year. Currently, all stores use the same store format for selling their products. Up until now, the company has treated all stores similarly, shipping the same amount of product to each store. This is beginning to cause problems as stores are suffering from product surpluses in some product categories and shortages in others. You've been asked to provide analytical support to make decisions about store formats and inventory planning.

* Determine the optimal number of store formats based on sales data.

### Task 2
The grocery store chain has 10 new stores opening up at the beginning of the year. The company wants to determine which store format each of the new stores should have. However, we don’t have sales data for these new stores yet, so we’ll have to determine the format using each of the new store’s demographic data.

* Develop a model that predicts which segment a store falls into based on the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the population that resides in the area around each new store.

### Task 3
Fresh produce has a short life span, and due to increasing costs, the company wants to have an accurate monthly sales forecast.

* Prepare a monthly forecast for produce sales for the full year of 2016 for both existing and new stores.
